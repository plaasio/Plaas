# What is PLAAS?
Plaas is the name of the token and the technology that is used by the Agricultural business Plaasio which was founded in 2017 in 
Gaborone Botswana in partnership under satoshicentre group. The name plaas was picked to differentiate between Plaasio the company and 
Plaas the token. The name Plaas is an Afrikaans word that means a Farm

Plaas is a farmers decentralized blockchain platform that seeks to enable individual farmers and cooperatives to store their daily farm produce on the blockchain to ensure secure farm data records , tracking of animals through use of the RFID technology. 

# The PLAAS blockchain platform
In order to achieve its mandate, PLAAS is seeking to leverage blockchain technology by providing all the players in the African agricultural sector with a platform where they can store and share information about crops and animals securely. The platform works by using blockchain technology to store sensitive agricultural data like the breed and ancestry of animals to help buyers identify the traits of the animals that they are buying. This gives insight of whether the animal is able to produce high yields based on the past ancestry and the conditions of the new farm. Additionally, the platform also provides information on plants and animals to keep track of the food security in the country remotely. This is done by leveraging RFID information and combining it with blockchain technology to ensure all the animals in the platform can be tracked, and their genetic information is available to users.

And also provided farmers not only farmers but people in the agricultural sector with an online market place for buyers and sellers where they will be using the native PLS token to remit payments. Cooperatives can also use the platform to track the contributions of the farmers and disburse payment through the platform to avoid fraud and mismanagement of resources. The main purpose is the growth of the platform.
Players in the agricultural sector can use the platform to share information about crops and animals securely
One of things also Plaas is to help make genetic easy 
That is we can have geneticist develop a cow with particular traits e.g maybe without horns or cows adapted for particular dry area this means farmers will be able to purchase genetic material from genetists and improve their livestock
So scientists developing genetic material can store this information on ethereum contract and have it available for farmers 
And the blockchain as a source of truth will make this possible and verifiable.

# RFID and sensor technology
PLAAS combines RFID with blockchain technology to provide an animal tracking system. Additionally, the RFID chips hold information that can be read using an RFID reader, RFID(the chip and RFID will be working together. The information on the chips will include the owner of the animal and the genetic information. In the case of plants, PLAAS leverages wireless sensors that are set up in participating farms allowing easy monitoring of the planting, growth, and harvesting of crops remotely. The information in the sensors and RFID are captured in real-time and relayed to the blockchain

We will be chipping animals recorded in the platform using the Radio Frequency Identification (tech) so the details contained in the RFID will for example be cows date of birth breed and heredity details healthy history and also geolocation information

When a cow is at the slaughter house the machines can scan the chip which is basically an   ethereum address and can review all the data there…

The slaughter house will have a private key that signs the ethereum address and signals on the Plaas smart contract to reduct the ethereum address

This done to confirm  if the information about that particular cow is true and then can save the transaction hash and ethereum address on the database
